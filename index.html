								<br>While pursuing my desired degree, I am managing a full-time CSR supervisor job. When I'm not working or studying, you'll most likely find me reading or exploring lookouts with friends. Technology has the facility to impact lives at a calibre and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The conception that something I engender can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology. </p>
								<p>IT has always been a great source of regalement for me since I was introduced to coding in primary and secondary grade. My passion for web development and software made me select information technology as a unit in year 9 and 10. I was able to gain rudimental skills and
								understand the mechanism. Most of my IT experience is from self-education and working in different field and utilizing various software. Despite my lack of experience, I am passionate
								about programming and development. I especially enjoy the puzzle-like frameworks that go into
								designing a program. I really love networking, as well as all the technical information that fall
								under the larger umbrella of networking.</p>
								<p>
								I dote experimenting with different languages of computer, so I customarily spend my leisure
								time inscribing my own code or edifying myself an incipient coding language from rudimentary level.

								<h3>Group processes</h3>
								<p>
								Team Orion collaborated very well together accomplish assignment two. Despite limitations and
								challenges beyond our control, we were able to communicate effectively and implement roles
								and responsibilities to increase productivity. Our group formed late, and one team member did
								not respond after two meetings, so there was a slight rush at the last minute. Building on our
								weaknesses and strengths from assignment 2, we believe that continuing the same Progress
								Plan will ensure a success in assignment 3.
								</p>
								<p>
								There was some consternation in last submission due to one team member who is no longer in
								the team so we are positive that this issue will not occur in this or our last assignment. To avoid
								any risks, we all agreed to start the assignment earlier this time, enabling us to spend more time
								reviewing and revising our project.
								</p>
								<p>
								We have all discussed two grades of assessment and are currently using constructive feedback
								to improve our teamwork. In my opinion, Team Orion is made up of wonderful people
								who want to achieve the best results.
								</p>
								<h3>Career Plans</h3>
								<p>
								Working with the IT team at my current job has already put my desired career goal into action. I
								intend to immerse myself as much as possible in IT-related activities in order to have a better
								understanding of what it takes to build and manage a successful IT firm. My ongoing studies and app development on my own time will help this self-immersion, which I want to use to expedite my start-up and generate my own mobile application. I believe that working for a
								smaller IT firm will be a significant step towards obtaining my ideal job because the setting will allow for more individualised learning and involvement with peers, technology, and clients.
								</p>
								<p>
								Despite the fact that my career plan appears to be short- to medium-term, I believe that this
								focus on achievement is critical to the broader path I intend to take to achieve my goal. If I am
								successful, my long-term career ambitions will be to maintain and grow my technological and
								business abilities in order to become a leader in Australia's information technology sector, and
								eventually to assist other Australians in achieving their IT ambitions.								
								</p>
								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
								<p>Megha Patel: Tech Lead
								<br>Tech leads are in charge of managing the technical aspects of the software development process
								in a specific context. A good tech lead is a software engineer who enables the team to work with
								quality and ensures the success of distributed solutions</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Pratibha K C:
								<br>Prioritizing user requirements, overseeing system upgrades, and researching new tools are all
								responsibilities of an IT Analyst. Pratibha will need to be highly analytical and able to

								are required, which are also aspects of my roles and responsibilities. The ideal job will
								necessitate collaboration with an IT analyst to discuss the project and the risks to the business and clients. </p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Suruchi Shrestha:
								<br>Suruchi Shrestha's ideal job would be to become an IT teacher who is up to date on the latest IT
								trends and enjoys sharing their knowledge with their students. Students learn the fundamentals
								of technology and how to apply basic information technology tools in their daily work and lives.
								They teach in elementary, middle, and high schools. My ideal job and her ideal job do intersect
								at some point. She must</p>
								<p>Contrasted to Malak and Shruti:

								company. I must guide the software development or software development team and check out
								specific topics such as software development, design tasks and product versions. IT managers,
								who are ideal for Malak and Shruti, determine the company's IT needs and are responsible for
								implementing computer systems that meet the requirements of the business information system.</p>

								<p>Student Email Address: S3909823@student.rmit.edu.au
								<br>Locale: Sydney, Australia
								<br>I am a creative and innovative person. I am a quick learner and can give the actual shape to my imaginations. I have interests in sketching and reading. I have master’s in Professional
								Accounting and Running master’s in teaching (Secondary) and Diploma of Information
								Technology. I speak English, Nepali and Hindi. 
								</p>
								<p>
								I find programming part interesting in IT. When I was doing programming language in my
								Bachelor’s in Business Administration as a part of curriculum, my desire to learn more about
								programming language grew. I joined web designing course and learnt Html, CSS,
								Dreamweaver, and Java script there. Being in management field, I never found the
								programming language uninteresting. For, IT is the growing field and have wide scope in
								careers, I can’t be separated from aspects of IT despite of any profession I choose. Having
								completed my master’s degree, I have decided to satisfy my interest in IT by doing Diploma of
								Information Technology at RMIT. My knowledge about IT will always help me to excel in my
								career. I expect to develop an IT base of my knowledge to help prosper in my career no matter
								which profession I choose as IT is an integral part in all fields.

								<h3>Group processes</h3>
								
								<p>When I went through the assignment before joining the group, I was truly nervous thinking that
								how it was going to work. Then we formed a team of six for our assignment two. Thanks to my
								wonderful teammates, Megha, Malak, Shruti and Suruchi for collaborating in a group and
								accomplishing the tasks smoothly. Most thanks to Megha for leading us with her super leadership
								skills. We have been a good team, always being ready to help each other and contribute fully to
								the assignment. In our first group assignment, we received minimum or almost zero contribution
								from Muhammad Rawnak, so we decided not to take him in second group assignment. Thanks
								to the lecturer that our request of removing him from the group was accepted. </p>
								<p>After submitting assignment two, we soon started discussing about next group project. We started
								our team meeting and allocated parts to each team member along with deadlines. By 18th May, all our writing part was accomplished, and we were ready for the preparation of individual video
								presentation. This time, group work ran more smoothly than last time with timely and clear
								communication about allocation, confusion, and the update. All members attended most of the team meetings. There was no last-minute withdrawal like before, so we were able to finish our assignment on time and without stress.</p>
								<p>
								Thinking about the team meeting, I feel so wonderful that I got new friends and I totally enjoyed sharing my ideas with them without any hesitation. Thank you all for being so open and less critical.</p>
								<p>I must thank the course outline of this subject for including the group assignments. I came to know a diverse range of people, some with similar background as mine, and some with different background. Despite being diverse, we did not lack unity. Most sensitive part was the emotional support that I got from my team members when my family members were fighting COVID-19 back in home.</p>
								<p>Conclusively, we did a great job being a team. We never lacked sense of belonging and always
								respected others’ ideas and suggestions. From this teamwork I learnt that group effort is greater when the individual efforts are effectively combined.
								</p>
								
								
								<h3>Career Plans</h3>
								<p>IT is a vast discipline and has wide range of career aspects. I choose to become an IT SOX
								Compliance analyst. The position requires to work together with finance and IT team to provide continuous SOX guidance and support. This position is attractive to me as I will have to work
								together with finance team in a higher secondary education environment. This means I will have proper knowledge from my respective degrees to perform this role. The position requires three years plus experience in IT Audit, compliance or public accounting and having worked in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) IT General Controls regulation preferably in large accounting firm with ASX Clients. The role needs the skill to collaborate with the teams located in different geographical locations.
								<br>My other team members choose to become IT manager, Chief technology officer, technical lead,
								and an IT teacher. </p>
								
								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
								<p>Pratibha K C: IT SOX Compliance Analyst
								<br>My dream job IT SOX Compliance Analyst is a blend of both finance and IT. It is an IT role but within the rules and regulation of Sarbanes- Oxley Act which protects the rights of shareholders, stakeholders, and public. This role does not only require the knowledge and experience in IT, but also requires the experience, in accounting, auditing, and SOX compliance framework. I chose a blend of these subjects because of having background. 
								</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Megha Patel:
								<br>Technical lead is directly related to IT as the role require to lead and organise the IT team. Being a technical lead, Megha will require to lead the technical experts in a company which looks after software development, design, and product launches. Comparing with my ideal job, Megha will require more leadership skills and technical skills than me. We both will have to provide technical support. We both may require doing coding and communication skills is vital in both job titles. While technical lead is purely an IT work, my job is the blend of finance and IT.
								</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Suruchi Shrestha:
								<br>IT teacher is also a blended career of IT and education. This role requires an up-to date knowledge about IT trends and developments along with the syllabus requirements. Comparing with my role, Suruchi’s role is different. I will need to work with IT and Finance department, but Suruchi will need to deal with students and her colleagues. She may need to have good programming skills to teach other students. She needs strong leadership qualities than me to influence her students’ learning. I will have to work in a team, whereas Suruchi can work independently.
								</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Shruti Shrestha and Malak Khan:
								<br>Similar to my job, IT manager is also the mix of IT and management. This role requires a combined skill set of IT, planning, staffing, organising, leading, and controlling the organisational resources. As managers, Shruti and Malak will have to look after the company’s electronic networks and resources of IT department. They may have to deal with several vendors and customer companies to contract their IT services. Being a manager needs high skills sets and experience. I personally, think that an IT manager is a challenging role. Comparing to their role, my responsibility as an IT SOX compliance analyst will be limited to IT and Finance. They require more experience and skill sets than my job requires. All the dream jobs of my team need a specialised IT as well as personal skill sets. Educational degree along with field experience will prepare us for the job professionals that we have dreamt to become. Without foundation knowledge about IT, we won’t reach there. All the jobs will require coding, software, hardware, and applications. So, no matter what we choose to become, IT is an inseparable context in our career.
								<br>As a graduate of education, management, accounting, and IT, I would appreciate to pursue my career in the field where I can utilize my all knowledges and skills. So, IT SOX Compliance analyst in an educational setting is a perfect dream job for me.

								<br>Locale: Sydney, Australia
								<br>I am currently opting to fulfill the master’s degree in teaching. IT has been playing an influencing role for the students as well as teachers that assist in better understanding. I have been interested in taking up the ICT course which would help me in future growth. I graduated with Bachelor of professional Accounting on 2018. I speak English, Nepali, Hindi. My hobbies are Reading books and exploring new places.
								</p>
								<p> It is evident from my information shared in the above section that I do not have any background in IT. This course is taken up by me as I want to pursue a master’s degree in teaching and currently, ICT is transforming the learning environments. In this regard, my interest in the course is mainly developed from the point that having knowledge on this would enhance the education quality.
								</p>
								<p> The teachers also need to be further updated with the needed technical skills and thereby enhance the teaching skills. I don't have any experience or background in IT, so it is all about the role of ICT in improving education that compelled me to take up the course. I have taken up admission in RMIT as the university offers the course and prepares for success. During my studies, I will be exploring and learning new concepts, ideas as well as equipping myself with the required knowledge.

								<h3>Group processes</h3>
								
								<p>Without a doubt, our team did an outstanding job on assignment 2. Our team members communicated well and contributed effectively. Our assignment started a little late, but everything went smoothly after our first meeting. Everyone in our group put in a lot of effort and completed their assigned tasks on schedule except one team member (Rawnak). He was out of contact and attended only few meetings. He did not even complete his assigned task and made some excuses at the end of submission time. But anyhow we managed to complete our assignment with rest of our team of five. Our group members assisted each other in completing the assignment in a timely and efficient manner. All in the group were very humble and willing to share their thoughts. Our group leader (Megha) did an outstanding job engaging with us and managing our assignments. We completed assignment 2 with the aid of each member of our group and received good grades. 
								</p> 
								<p>We have made improvements in our group because of the carelessness of one of our team members (Rawnak). We've pushed him out of the team and are now collaborating as a fiveperson team. I believe that with this move, we will be much more efficient and will have no problems completing our third assignment. We have also implemented our meeting schedules and started early to complete our task.
								</p>
								<h3>Career Plans</h3>
								<p>I am now pursuing a master’s in teaching degree in order to further my expertise in the area of education. Teachers must also keep up to date on professional skills, which is why I enrolled in an IT course to supplement my teaching degree. Throughout my studies, I will be researching and discovering new principles, theories, and equipping myself with the skills necessary to achieve my goals.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
								<p>Suruchi Shrestha: IT Teacher 
								<br>Unlike the rest of my group, I'm taking this course because I want to get a master’s degree in education, and ICT is transforming the way people study. In this regard, my interest in the course derives mostly from the fact that learning more about it would increase educational standards. Successful IT teachers keep up with latest IT trends and enjoy sharing their knowledge with their students. IT teachers educate students about technological principles and how to use basic information technology methods in their careers and daily lives. Students in elementary, middle, and high school are taught by them.
								</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Megha Patel:
								<br>Her dream career is to work as a technical lead for a software or technology firm. They are in charge of a corporate strategy or software engineering unit, and they regularly examine specialised subjects including software development, construction tasks, and product releases. Whereas, an IT instructor should only cover the basics of computers, laptops, printers, routers, projectors, and electric whiteboards, as well as Photoshop, Illustrator, and grade book software and networks to ensure that all computers in the computer lab are wired and usable.
								</p>
								<p> Contrasted to Pratibha K C:

								<br>Her ambition is to work as a SOX Analyst. Sarbanes-Oxley Analysts develop and implement processes to ensure the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements are fulfilled. Data on financial statements internal accounting processes are gathered, analysed, and released. IT teachers, on the other hand, must keep up with market trends. This includes career learning and continued education, professional development courses as well as self-learning.
								</p> 
								<p> Contrasted to Shruti Shrestha and Malak Khan: 
								<br>I found that Malak Khan and Shruti Shrestha both want to be an IT manager when I looked at the ideal careers of my group members. The electronic networks and IT divisions of a company are managed by IT managers. To advance to a senior level, you'll typically need multiple years of business experience, as well as an IT management master's degree. When compared my ideal career to theirs, an IT instructor needs a bachelor's degree in education and a specialisation in information technology.

								<br>I come from Nepal. My hobbies are traveling, cooking delicious Nepalese cuisines, watching movies, and reading romantic novels. I have studied Accounting my whole life but my interest in IT grew up when I first came here in Australia when I realised that it plays a significant role in accounting or in any other sectors. IT has enabled companies to develop and use computerised designs to collect and store financial transactions rather than storing in hard books.</p>
								<p>There is not a particular event or person that sparked my interest in IT, but I wanted to develop knowledge and skills in technology so that it would benefit me personally and professionally. As I do not have any background in IT whatsoever, I saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow new skills when I came around this course.</p> 
								<p>I am currently studying Master of Teaching in Alphacrusis College. Even though I wanted to study IT, I did not want to get separate degree on IT. Hence, I decided to go with Open Universities where I can study a single subject online at my own pace.

								<h3>Group processes</h3>
								<p>At the starting of Assignment 2, all six members were very excited. In fact, our first meeting was fruitful. Megha was very forward and showed leadership qualities. She was perfect to be our team leader. We all decided about how we will be able to contribute to the assignment. We divided our tasks as per our individual strength and weakness. We all were providing updates about our progress through texts or video chats, but one team member started ignoring our texts or calls. He always had a reason no to attend the meeting or for a late reply. He did not say if he had any problem with his part of the assignment. We gave him more than enough chances to correct his mistakes.
								</p>
								<p>
								At last, just a few days before the due date, he said that he would not be able to finish his part. We all were very disappointed with him. Malak was so sweet that he agreed to do his part at the last moment. We will never be able to thank him enough because we would not be able to finish the assignment without his help.</p>
								<p>As Rawnak did not contribute to the second assignment, all team members decided that our team would be fine without him. We decided to remove him from the group. We were not disappointed because he did not finish his part, but he waited until the last minute to inform us. We were always open to communication, and we are now too. We are only five group members now, and we have a lot to do in Assignment 3. We are conducting our meetings twice a week; also, we are always connected through chats and texts. We are confident with our parts, and assignment progress is good so far.

								<h3>Career Plans</h3>
								<p>
								<br>Shruti Shrestha: IT Manager 
								<br>My ideal job is IT Manager at Dunbrae Pty Ltd. It requires more than 8 years of experience in IT field. The role of this job is to look after daily IT works of the company. Contrasted to Megha Patel: Her ideal job is digital tech lead. She will be responsible for the technical architecture and software development. Her ideal job and my ideal job are similar in terms that we need to manage our teams and deliver our projects. We both need to be expert in programming language and managing skills.
								</p>
								<p>Contrasted to Pratibha K C: 
								<br>Her ideal job is an IT SOX Compliance Analyst. This job requires only 3 years of experience whereas the job of IT Manager requires 8 years of experience. Her job also needs experience in IT Audit, public accounting and compliance whereas my job is more about managing different groups and supervising various IT projects.
								</p>
								
								<p>Contrasted to Suruchi Shrestha:
								<br>Her ideal job is IT teacher. She is pursuing Master of Teaching and hopefully wants to teach IT in schools. Her ideal job is completely different than mine. She can become IT teacher as soon as she finishes her master’s degree with minimum experience. However, I will have to work for 8 years to be eligible for my ideal job. Her ideal job is not in the list of Burning Glass.
								</p>
								<p>Contrasted to Malak Khan:
								<br>His ideal job is to become an IT Manager in a reputed firm. His ideal job is same as mine. His job has responsibilities like maintaining technological needs of the company and managing IT teams which are similar as responsibilities of my ideal job

								<br>Your Locale: Sydney, Australia
								<br>I am a Pakistani Australian by nationality and Yousufzai Afghan or Pathan by ethnicity. I have done bachelor’s in business administration. I am qualified and worked in a number of areas in Australia as well as overseas i.e., real estate, hospitality, OH&S, manufacturing, transport and warehousing. Beside my education and employment experiences I have owned and managed my personal businesses named SMG Pty ltd and Instant Computing solutions Pty ltd. My hobbies and interests include gardening, travelling, exploring different cultures and cuisines, enjoying nature and photography. PlayStation gaming. Cricket and badminton are my favourite sports.
								</p> 
								<p> 
								My interest in IT has a unique background which is related to my dear father. My father was a banker was amongst the very first few customers in who bought a computer system in early 1990’s. Our first computer system had 386 MHz CPU with around 4 MBs of RAM and flexible floppy disk as ROM. I was updating my skills and knowledge with latest trends and updates in new operating systems, applications, and IT systems. It was from this childhood passion that an appealing IT interest for career related future was born which I followed through informal learning and practices in past by setting up and managing my own IT business named as Instant computing solutions. I achieved moderate experience in different areas of IT from software, hardware and to setting up small networks etc. I would like to explore and broaden my knowledge of IT in these specific areas databases, networking, Internet security, cloud services, software, and hardware. I would like to further enhance and refine my IT skills in this flourishing and demanding industry.

								<h3>Group processes</h3>
								<p>I found the whole experience of working in the group very productive. Honestly, I had my reservations about working in a group and thought it might not be that, but I was very much relieved after our first meeting. All the members were very target driven and cooperative especially our group leader Megha Patel. She is very fair and organized. She was always considerate about the needs of the group's members like timing of the meetings, distribution of tasks and was always very responsive to our queries and concerns. If all the members contributed and cooperated equally our group would have achieved better results in shorter span of time and lesser headache for our group leader in assignment 2. I thought two of the group members Shruti Shreshta and Suruchi Shreshta were sister because they have the same surname and resemble looks wise for quite some time but found out it was just a coincidence.
								</p>
								<p> One of the main changes we made to our group in assignement 3 is that we have removed Muhammad Rawnak as he did not contribute anything in the assignment 2. Another main group process improvement that we have focused is to have all communications, interactions, and submission of file on Microsoft teams instead of other communication apps like text messaging or WhatsApp to have an organised and secure track records of all team members communication.
								</p>
								<p> Groups can have different types of members. Some would go out of the way to achieve group goals and others are least concerned and would not take things seriously. Working with people from different backgrounds, one can learn a lot. Working in a group helps achieve bigger tasks more efficiently as you save time by distributing the work and you get to have a pool of different abilities
								</p>
								<h3>Career Plan</h3>
								<p>My career plan is to secure a senior IT management role in a reputable firm. As I mentioned already about my passion for computers and IT plus a background in management and administration makes it the most suitable and desirable job for me. Secondly this field has a neverending potential as technology or IT department is almost essential to any big and successful organization and for that they need an IT manager. It is one of the fastest growing industry with plenty of room for career advancement and offer handsome salary packages of more than 100k. According to U.S. News and World Report recently IT managers is ranked as the third best technology job in 2021, and the 12th best job overall. With growing investment of organization into digital transformation the demand for technology leaders is on rise. Organization like banks, hospitals etc. need IT managers to be able to secure, store and analyse vast amounts of data. I would like to explore and broaden my knowledge of IT in these specific areas databases, networking, Internet security, cloud services, software and hardware. After having a thorough research online, I found RMIT to be the best in IT courses. Through BIT course from RMIT I would like to further enhance and refine my IT skills in this flourishing and demanding industry. I plan to do MBA in technology management or MIT to attain and advance my skills and knowledge in this field. I intend to join internship programs with reputable firms for further practical knowledge and experience as a step to achieve my ideal role. Other skills I need to work on are:
								<ul>
									<li>Cybersecurity</li>
									<li>Cloud computing</li>
									<li>Data analytics and data science</li>
									<li>Software development</li>
									<li>AI and machine learning</li>
									<li>IT service management</li>
									<li>Virtualization</li>
									<li>I love this field and I believe if you are passionate about the work you do, success is inevitable.li>

								<br>Ideal job of Megha Patel is a technical lead who is an expert that manages a group of technical staff at a software or technology organization. They regularly lead software development or software engineering team and investigate specialized issues that include software development, designing assignments and product releases. While an IT manager which is an ideal job of minedetermine the IT requirements of the business and are responsible for implementing computer systems to meet the business information system's needs.
								<br>A technical lead requires to have a proficient experience with software development and a significant knowledge of technology, yet they will be adequately equipped to feasibly lead a group and work along with others. A technical lead is responsible for assisting their colleagues with the technical parts of their positions, like coding and programming. They may describe new projects to their group and investigate any issues that occur.

The position of IT manager emerged from the IT department to be "the face" for an organization' internal teams and the units it serves. It is the IT manager’s job to keep consistent business measures running effectively so the organization is productive and runs smoothly. IT managers needs information on IT systems and processes however it's not important for them to be a system specialist themselves. Their job is to understand what technology and IT can help the effective running of an organization. In case if certain process requires enhancing or if automation can streamline the back office, then the IT managers should be informed in first place.

										</p>
										
										<h3>Comment on Audit Trail on the Git Repository </h3>
										<p>Problem-solving can be aided by working together as a group. When people work together, they can find the most appropriate solutions. The project team is responsible for contributing to the overall project objectives and individual team deliverables by helping to plan project activities and completing assigned tasks/work within planned quality levels to ensure the project's success. To keep the workload to a minimum, this assignment needed teamwork and task splitting. The group agreed to distribute the work based on their ability and willingness to work on each part. Each participant was expected to produce high-quality work and adhere to the principles discussed at the first meeting.
										</p>
										<p> Megha was responsible for the GitHub repository and website in order to expand the knowledge into new areas. This is evident on the website, where she was able to incorporate a back button that enables users to return to the previous tab. In Assignment 1, the viewer was required to exit the entire page and restart from the ‘Home' page. Different list methods were used and experimented to offer the website the ‘report layout’, and descriptive comments were added to each commit. Writing commit comments was crucial because it helped the team to see how far the website code had progressed. The complete list of commits, along with their comments, can be found in the GitHub repository.
										</p>
										<p>
										Megha also managed the group by organising meetings, editing, and documenting the work each member submitted.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Collaboration Tools </h3>
										<h4>Collaboration Tools </h4>
										<p>A virtual workspace that centralises resources and tools to promote collaboration and personal participation in corporate project work is known as a shared platform.</p>
										<h4>Microsoft Teams </h4>
										<p>Microsoft Teams is a team collaboration tool that allows you to keep your entire team together and collaborate with them in one place.
										</p>
										<p>We used Teams because team members can join existing networks or create their own. Members of networks can hold on-the-spot meetings, talk, and share files. Team members would be able to see what is planned for the day or week. Alternatively, you could call a meeting. Members can use Activity to catch up on all their unread messages, @mentions, replies, and more. Productivity and teamwork will improve for the team.
										</p>
										<p>Transparency has improved – Keeping everyone in the loop and making everyone feel like they know what's going on is a huge challenge for many businesses.
										</p>
										<h4>Trello </h4>
										<p>Trello is a project management and productivity tool based on the Kanban method. Using notes/cards, the Kanban technique tracks the status (or swim lanes) of discrete deliverables/objectives. Trello will be used to manage project deliverables and other projects, as well as to communicate about them. Trello enabled team members to quickly see which tasks had been assigned to them, which tasks were complete or incomplete, and which actions were due next. Each team member is responsible for reviewing Trello, marking completed tasks, and planning the next mission.
										</p>
										<h4>Rmit Canvas </h4>
										<p>RMIT's learning management system contains all our course announcements and resources, such as class notes and tools (lms). Canvas will also be used for class participation, completing assessments, displaying, and submitting assignments, and receiving grades and feedback.
										</p>
										<h4>Emails </h4>
										<p>The RMIT email system is available to all students. When Team Alpha was having difficulty contacting team members, they used email as a backup communication channel. It was essentially troubleshooting with any team members who did not use Teams.

										<h3>App Name: Gaze - We are Looking!</h3>
										
										<p>
										The application that our group has chosen to work on is a mobile application (app) named
										“Gaze”. The app is a platform where users can report emergency incidents or crime.
										</p>
										<p>
										After considerable deliberation, we validated that there was no application on the market that allowed users to report any incidents with a few clicks, which is a completely untouchable market segment. In the early stages of idea development and project development, the tea agreed on what least viable features, as well as some advanced features that were considered "desirable".
										</p>
										<p>
										At a minimum, the Gaze mobile application will be able to notify users of the video, audio, or image input feature of a crime / emergency. The goal of our group was to make the experience as smooth as possible and to provide the user with a full-fledged experience that includes fast features, suggestions, and easy search. When using the system, the user will have the option to login, sign up or they can avoid this step, which will give them full control over the app. There are no restrictions when reporting an incident because they can hide their identity if they do not feel safe or comfortable. The process of reporting on the app is designed to be intuitive, users can add audio, video, or photo about the incident.

								<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
								<h3>Topic</h3>
								<p>Our project concept is based on developing an app for emergency services reporting that includes a few simple steps for easy and quick reporting. The app's main purpose is to be easily accessible and to provide firsthand information to the end user in the shortest amount of time. Because of its simple and easy-to-use interface, it will appeal to a wide range of age groups, from children to the elderly. We believe it can be more effective than traditional methods such as phone reporting or, in some cases, reporting an incident or crime on a website, which can be time-consuming and complex.
								</p>
								<p>According to our research, the app's strength lies in its uniqueness and design; no such apps are available in the market. It has the potential to completely transform the way we report crime or incidents. According to one study, the average person spends five to six hours per day using their mobile phone, and another study shows that people use social apps to chat to friends versus calling friends for two hours. Based on this trend, there is a strong probability that people will report crime/incident on app as opposed to traditional methods of calling or web browser based online reporting.
								</p>
								<h3>Motivation </h3>
								<p>
								The motivation for ‘Gaze’ stems from a range of areas. Firstly, the collective desire to pursue a venture that will be challenging and rewarding, yet achievable, drew the team strongly towards this project. Individually, each team member has expressed a strong interest in designing and developing the project. Most important however is the team's enthusiasm for creating a valuable program with the ability to service real-world users. This platform will improve the lives of those who wish to report an emergency service or file a case/complaint.
								</p>
								<p>
								‘Gaze’ is more concerned with community service than with entertainment. As a result, it may be more accurate to say that they have a greater impact on the economic world than on the IT world. Though it is true that because there is a large market for government and services, there will inevitably be a demand for our project ‘Gaze’.
								</p>
								<p>
								Any employer who hires our team to create ‘Gaze’ can expect a well-thought-out and challenging experience to provide to customers in need of an app fix.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Landscape</h3>
								<p>
								There are numerous government apps available, but none of them offer the functionality that Gaze does. There are some apps of this type available, but this will have an advantage that will make it sustainable because it will have features such as recording or taking a picture of the crime or emergency, unlike other facilities such as 000, where you have to call and explain everything, which may put the person reporting in danger.
								</p>
								<p>
								Other than government sectors, few businesses invest their time in developing this type of app because there is no turnaround. Except for government apps like services NSW, we don't have many competitors right now.

							<article id ="PlansAchieve">
							<h3 class="major">Plans to take to achieve our goals</h3>
							<p>Most of the ideas for a new app comes from an already existing app. It is a great way to develop app ideas by adding some new features that one thinks will make the app more useful or by combining the features of two or more apps into one single app. Another way to make a great new app is to find a solution that one is facing in day-to-day life; the problem can be about the minor things in life.
							</p>
							<p> 
							It is enticing to make an application with a ton of features. This just clouds the one thing your application is acceptable at. It is better to ensure that your application does one thing and does it well. The name of our application is ‘Gaze’. In the second assignment, we had to work in a group of 4 to 6 to produce a report on various aspects of the IT industry and a plan for an IT project to begin development work on Assignment 3 eventually. We formed a group of six members. We wanted to develop an app to make society a better place by enabling layman to report crimes and emergency incidents effortlessly without putting themselves in danger and help the concerned departments work more efficiently, minimizing the chances of losing lives and other damages. ‘Gaze’ is an app to report any emergency or incident on the spot with just four quick taps on their smartphone (IOS or Android) in the form of a picture, video, or audio clip.
							</p>
							<h3>Actions (steps we plan to take to achieve our goals)</h3>
							<h4>1. Number of Platforms:</h4>
							<p>
							The target age group of users of the app are between 10-50 years. Most of these age groups use smartphones. Based on this factor, we plan to choose the two leading platforms (iPhones and Android). We also want to create a web page for this app. Users will be able to download the free app from App Store on iPhones or Google Play on Android phones.
							</p>
							<p>
							We are in the initial phase of the app, and we have not fully developed the app. In the meantime, we cannot find the ‘Gaze’ app in the App Store and Google Play. Hence, the users will not be able to download the app and use it for now. Once we have the resources to finish the app and all tests are done, the app will be ready to be launched in the market. That is our ultimate goal.
							</p>
							
							<h4>2. User Login:</h4>
							<p>
							Clients will be able to create a user account by using an email and password or log in with their Facebook, Twitter, and Google accounts. Clients will want to set a username, profile photograph and short description about themselves. There will two types of accounts: normal and VIP. Normal account holders can use the app for free, but there will be advertisements in the app, whereas VIP users will have to pay the minimum charge. However, they will be able to access the app without any advertisements, and they will be provided with unique features that normal users cannot access.
							</p>
							<p>
							To date, we have been able to create the user login. However, only the free version of the app is available for now with the main features. We still need to work on the VIP accounts with the special features.
							</p>
							
							<h4>3. Number of Screens:</h4>
							<p>We have accomplished creating the first page of the app, i.e., home page of the application. Users can sign in with their email address and password if they have an account with ‘Gaze’. If not, they have the option to continue as a Guest, or they can sign up.
							</p>
							<p>The second page is the user's profile, quick access and setting page. The users can quickly access other pages like home, user's profile, reports, results, records of incidents, news, and settings on this page. Here, we were able to utilize a slide inside menu to explore the different segments of the application.
							</p>
							<p>The third page is called submit a new report, where the users can submit a new report of an emergency or accident. The incidents may be reported to the police, ambulance, or fire department.
								</p>
							<p>The fourth page is the submission type of the report where the users can choose audio, video, or photo to file up their case.
								</p>
							<p>The fifth page is the type of incident where the users can select what type of incident they have faced or seen. They can search in their incident in the search engine, and if not, they can select from the various options given in the menu bar.
								</p>
							<p>The sixth page is the location page, where the users can manually type the location where the incident took place or use current location options where their phone's GPS will autolocate itself. There is a separate box where the users can write about the details of the incident.
								</p>
							<p>We are happy to complete these six pages till now for the basic functioning of the ‘Gaze’ app. In the future, we will add more pages and features as per the requirement of the app.
								</p>
							
							<h4>4. Navigation:</h4>		
							<p>Now, afterthought about different sections or that will be in the app, the next was to determine the main navigating system inside the app. The best kind of navigation is one that feels normal and instinctive. Our focus was on how one will explore the application. We decided that the app will utilize a slide inside menu to explore the different segments of the application. Also, the slide-out sidebar is probably the best arrangement when one needs to make a plan that needs to look great on both large and small screens. It is a trade-off that gives us bunches of chance for experimentation, to say nothing regarding giving the additional room we need on cell phones.							
							</p>
							
							<h4>5. Prototype:</h4>	
							<p>We created a prototype of the ‘Gaze’ app to see and feel the app. We were able to make a high-fidelity prototype as soon as we decided on the app's features. It took less time and money. However, we will need money on app functions, features, and programming. Our prototype shows how the app looks and some essential elements of the app. We were successful to meet the standard design components provided by Apple in their iOS human interface guidelines.
							</p>
							
							<h4>6. Backend Development Requirements: </h4>
							<p>The app uses AWS cloud systems for its backend development requirements to store and retrieve information of reporting in the AWS cloud system. Standard AWS charges apply.
							</p>
							
							<h4>7. App integrations: </h4>
							<p>Publicly available APIs (i.e., Google Maps) is used by the app as an app integration for determining and then reporting the location of an incident.

							<h2 class="major">Processes & Communication</h2>
							<p>For most of the project, our team communicated effectively via Microsoft Teams. Through this application, each team member was in constant communication with one another, as well as scheduling a variety of different meetings each day, such as stand-ups, standdowns, mentor meetings, and general project meetings that could be ad hoc. Meetings became less frequent, and more results driven as the project progressed and deadlines approached. Some members still struggled with notifying other members when they weren't going to be available and were unable or unwilling to suggest times when they would be able to attend meetings.</p>
							<h3>Communication Expectation </h3>

							<h2>Solution</h2>
							<p>Any software development firm should test their products. It's a time-consuming process, but properly testing an app before releasing it avoids user issues. So, when you're testing an app, keep the following considerations in mind. It would eventually yield positive outcomes.</p>
							<p>We can use variety of simulators and emulators available in the market that can be used to compare which gives us a sense of screen size and appearance. Another option is to set up a mobile research lab with several computers to test on. Switching from one network to another for link forms provides greater clarification about how the app behaves. It's also essential to measure the app's efficiency by switching from 2G to 4G (Abusalim et al., 2021). Also, since the software sometimes goes into offline mode, it's interesting to verify what features are available when there's no internet link. </p>
							<p>The app's navigation should not be complicated or complex, but more user-friendly and straightforward. It's crucial to ensure that the layouts are transparent and that the colours and fonts are in understandable variations when checking. The answer time should be as short as possible so that the customer would not have to wait too long. Since it could store confidential information such as credit card details, medical health conditions, contact data, and so on, the software must be built with extreme caution from a security standpoint. To prevent data breaches, cryptography and algorithms must be used at all times. It's also important to run proven vulnerability checks with simulated attacks to evaluate a system's capabilities. It is important to provide translations in the regions where the software is published for internationalisation. It is important to ensure that the translations are correct and adhere to local grammar rules, since people nowadays have more choices and can easily find another app that meets their needs (Patel, 2017).</p>
							<p>When testing a smartphone app, the key goal should be to ensure that it meets industry standards and offers the newest approach to consumers. It is impossible to validate the software on all platforms, but what matters is that all end-to-end process flows are covered. It is the testers' duty to select the most effective and well-informed method for thoroughly testing the software (Muccini et al., 2012).</p>

							For most of the project, our team communicated effectively via Microsoft Teams. Through this
application, each team member was in constant communication with one another, as well as
scheduling a variety of different meetings each day, such as stand-ups, standdowns, mentor
meetings, and general project meetings that could be ad hoc. Meetings became less frequent,
and more results driven as the project progressed and deadlines approached. Some members
still struggled with notifying other members when they weren't going to be available and were
unable or unwilling to suggest times when they would be able to attend meetings.

							<h2 class="major">Risks</h2>
							<h3>Project Risk</h3>
							<h4>Current Risks</h4>
								<ol>
								<li>Requires high level of programming language: This app requires different programming language in different steps. So, a high level of knowledge in programming language to keep all the interfaces intact. We don’t have any programming or System building background making this project a major Risk. </li>
								<li>Broken Cryptography: Encryption problem can create security issues and data manipulation. So, superior encryption protocols are required to limit the outside intervention</li>
								<li>Weak Server- Side Controls: Budget issue and insufficient knowledge of programming can lead to weak control creating the security issue. Correct mapping out is essential to control this app</li>
								<li> Lack of Binary Protection: Due to the lack of binary protection, malware can be injected to the app via reverse engineering which can damage the brand name, and cause frauds and theft.</li>
								<li>Funding: The source of fund and process of fundraising is complicated and time consuming. As it expects, grants from government the app should be extraordinary and prove is feasibility to be eligible for the grant. The app should seem profitable to attract the funds from public investors. In worst case, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds for our project and our project may not be completed due to the lack of funds.</li>
								<li>Communication Risks: Communication is a vital issue in a group. In order to collaborate effectively, each team member should communicate clearly in the group. Lack of participation, lack of progress updates, lack of suggestions and recommendations and lack of response may fail the group project</li>
								<li>Technology Risks: This app requires high level of knowledge in programming language, iOS, and android software. It does not require memory or CPU. If the app developer is not competent our project design will not turn into a concrete form. If the programmed work is not stored properly, we may lose our work.</li>
								<li>. Exceeding Deadline and fund: There are risks that we won’t finish the project within planned date and may exceed the budgeted fund. The risk can be created by untimely update by team member about not being able to do the allocated part. We are going to solve this issue by allocating parts to each member and helping each other and using the fund wisely</li>
								<li>Team dynamics: Contradicting goals, poor management, competing responsibilities, late hour withdrawal can fail this group project.</li>
								</ol>
							
							<h4>Future Risks</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Security Decisions Via Untrusted Input: Hooking is another issue for app developers. It is the techniques used to alter the behaviour of the app by intercepting calls, messing with sensitive parameters. Hidden fields or functionalities used by the developers if its implementation is not strong enough an adversary can easily get higher level permission causing improper app behaviour. IPC (inter process communication) is used for the communication of clients and servers or between different apps. An attacker can intercept this communication and manipulate it by stealing information or malware introduction. </li>
								<li>Data Leakage: Unintended leakage of data due to the insecure storage of app data and easy access can lead to the misuse of the application. As the app developer have less control in data sharing in this app, users should limit the sharing important information.</li>
								<li>Poor Authorization and Authentication: As mobile internet is not that safe and reliable the apps need offline authentication to maintain uptime. Poor authentication can help adversary anonymously operate the app. It can lead to security loopholes, especially in the offline mode.</li>
								<li>Misuse/ Overuse: Users can misuse and overuse the app even in case of minor incidents. This app is targeted to teenagers too. Due to the overanxious nature, teenagers may use the apps even if there is no emergency.</li>
								<li>Requires Android or iOS device: The user will have to possess latest android and iOS technology to use the application. The users also need to be instructed about the steps of using the app. </li>
								<li>. Requires uploading audio, video, or photo as evidence: In case of emergencies, people panic. They may not realise what to do next. Uploading photo, video or audio can be too lengthy process in case of the situations that require immediate action. What if the person does not have enough time and resources to provide this evidence?</li>
								<li>Requires internet: The app will require data or wi-fi all the time to share location to police, ambulance, and fire services. </li>
							
							
							</ol>
						
							<h3>User Risk</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Data Leakage: Insecure connection for storing vital app data can lead to unintended leakage of data. Providing easy access to the data can cause misuse of the app by the outsiders. Negligence of security in the framework or OS bugs can cause other problems like unauthorized data leakage.</li>
								<li>User Safety: The app might raise issues related to user’s safety as they have to get  closer to active emergency areas and report the incident through recording audio or video clip or a picture which can put them in a risky situation.</li>
								<li>Malware: Malware has always been a problem. It can steal sensitive data, can infect internal machine through internal network. They continue to evolve.</li>
								<li>Location data, privacy and surveillance: Location data collection may bring up issues about security and surveillance, the government's interest in such information, and the absence of oversight into location data tracking. Metadata related with content like recordings, which are needed to report incidents on the application, are additionally collected. Including unique device identifiers, data on wireless networks, location information etc which can all be tracked back to users, who would use the app utilizing their names, email addresses and telephone numbers.</li>
								<li>. Privacy and Advertising: Location data is essential part of the app, and the users might be sceptical of using it as its sale is growing and largely unregulated in most cases. Private companies collect users’ movements through popular mobile phone apps and sell the data to advertising companies and data brokers. It is even completely legal to collect location data.</li>
								
							</ol>
							<h3>Users’ Perspective</h3>
							<h4>Current risks </h4>
							<ol>
								<li>A fully functioning smartphone: In the gaze app, the customers need to upload a picture, a video clip, or an audio clip to report the accident or emergency. Hence, the customer needs a phone which can take pictures and videos. The phone should also have inbuilt GPS so that the phone can be auto located. If the phone does not have these functions, the customers will not be able to use the gaze app. Also, if the phone is broken or damaged in the accident, the customers will not be able to report the accident</li>
								<li>A strong network: The mobile network should be strong so that location can be automatically shared which will save time and damage can be minimized. The auto location sharing of the app will save time and in case the victim or the reporting person is unable to tell the address. Other than that, the app requires good network so that the picture or clip can be uploaded as an evidence. Hence, it is a risk to users if they are trapped in places with bad or no mobile network.</li>
								<li>Poor authorization and authentication: As mobile internet is not that safe and reliable the apps need offline authentication to maintain uptime. Poor authentication can help adversary anonymously operate the app. It can lead to security loopholes, especially in the offline mode. Solution: Allowing users with low permission to execute actions that are only authorized to admins. That is why its preferable that in online mode logins are limited. </li>
								<li>Data leakage: Insecure connection for storing vital app data can lead to unintended leakage of data. Providing easy access to the data can cause misuse of the app by the outsiders. Negligence of security in the framework or OS bugs can cause other problems like unauthorized data leakage. Solution: Users can protect themselves from such security breaches by not sharing important and sensitive information as developers cannot do anything about it.</li>
								
							</ol>
							<h4>Future risks</h4>
							<ol>
							<li>Insecure Communication: In a typical mobile app, data is exchanged between client
and server. The app transmits data through the internet and the mobile network.
Hackers might exploit sensitive information and data of the users during the
transmission. Hence, the users of the gaze app might be at the risk of insecure
communication in the future. This will lead to an inconsistent security layer which further
increases the risk of exposing sensitive data such as credentials, personal information, session IDs, and more to interception by attackers</li>
							<li>Client Code Security: It is common to have code security issues in mobile apps. So,
we can anticipate that gaze app users might face this in the future. It might take ample
time to detect these issues, but third-party tools can be used to identify issues like
insecure data storage, weak encryption, and other security issues. We can maintain
consistent secure coding practices and use automation to find out memory leakage and
buffers overflow. This will increase mobile security and users will not be exploited.
</li>
							<li>The potential expense of in-app purchases: The gaze application is free; however,
some mobile apps do have an initial expense to download the app or involve minor
expenses later, such as download “extras” within the app or buying a premium version of
the app. The app is in the initial phase, and it is free of cost at the moment. On the other
hand, it is essential to remember that there might be minor fees the users might have to
spend once the app goes in the scale.</li>

							<h2 class="major">Tools And Technology</h2>
							<h3>	Development and Deployment Tools</h3>
							<p>These tools and technologies will be used to build ‘Gaze’. Each group member is the same level, no one has used and has experience using the tools. Front End for ‘Gaze’:
							</p>
							<h3>Front End for ‘Gaze’:</h3>
							<p>Gaze will be developed with the most up-to-date resources and technologies to meet users’ expectation. To ensure the Gaze is informative and user-friendly, it is essential to choose the required programming language.
							</p>
							
							<h3>‘Gaze’ Development Framework:</h3>
							<p>Research indicate that Xamarin is a coder’s delight. Xamarin would be our primary development framework to write Gaze with native user interfaces and share code across multiple platforms. Xamarin is a platform-agnostic development tool. It addresses issues that many developers face when creating cross-platform apps, such as separate coding languages and UI paradigms. C# can be used to create iOS, Android, and Universal Windows apps with Xamarin. (Xamarin 2021)
							</p>
							<p>The following Features are supported by Xamarin:
							<ul>
								<li>Use C#: Enables to write apps in C#. Existing C# code can be easily ported to iOS and Android or window apps using Xamarin.
								<li>Use MVC or MVVVM design patterns: Allows you to create the user interface for application using the Model/View/Controller pattern. User can decide which parts of app will use native user interface elements from each platform. and use this as a guideline to divide your app into two components: "Core" and "User-Interface."
								<li> Create native UIs – Each OS-specific application has a unique user-interface layer.
								<ul>
									<li>iOS – Use the UIKit APIs with iOS designer to design U
									<li>Android – Use Android.views with Xamarin's UI designer
									<li>Windows – Use XAML with Visual Studio or Blend’s UI
									<li> Use Xcode with Storyboards

								</ul>
							
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Benefits of Xamarin:
							<ul>
								<li>Excellent development platform to build native mobile apps with user interface andcontrols
								<li>cross-Platform App Development: Supports all the platforms
								<li>Fewer Bugs and insight tools aids in the recording and monitoring of crashes
								<li>API Integration
								<li>Useful Compiled Code and allows to access any native API
								<li>Easy to integrate with various SDKS and GDK
								<li>Shared Code Base with 40+ cross platform layout and controls
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Cost of Xamarin:
							<br>Xamarin Enterprise can cost as much $1899 every year. With that membership you get 'Prime Components'. These parts incorporate a profound library of pre-built application components intended to assist you with getting your applications finished quicker. Pre-designed UI controls and a variety of themes help make some of the more tedious aspects of development much easier. (Kurtz,2019)
							</p>
							<h3>‘Gaze’ Programming Language:</h3>
							<p>
							C# is an Object-Oriented programming language that will be used to create the Gaze was developed by Microsoft. The Xamarin framework (acquired by Microsoft) allows you to program in C# against the .NET framework. The .NET framework is implemented on the iOS platform using an open-source implementation called mono. (Chebbi 2019)
							</p>
							<h3>‘Gaze’ Development Tool:</h3>
							<p>Visual Studio: The popular IDEs for writing C# and Xamarin code for Gaze is Visual Studio Code by Microsoft. The C# code is cross-compiled and runs natively on the iOS or Android device. This allows for a no-lag execution that comes very close to native development. There are special extensions called Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android that you can use to access iOS and Android native capabilities that can be called from C#. For iOS, you need XCode on a Mac machine to build the installable iOS app. (Chebbi 2019)
							</p>
							<P>We need to use the best programming language available when designing the Gaze, considering the features, reliability, efficiency, and how it will stand out in the market	
							</p>
							
							<h3>Backend Frameworks for ‘Gaze’:</h3>
							<p>
							ASP.NET Core is the main backend framework for Gaze from Microsoft which supports crossplatform support that is used explicitly for creating internet-connected or cloud-based applications. We can choose .NET or C# for the development purpose. (CM 2021)
							</p>
							<p>Features offered by this backend framework.
							<ul>
								<li>With the Framework, you can get high-end performance, and this is possible because of its Kestrel web server.
								<li>It offers support for asynchronous programming patterns.
								<li>This Framework also offers a new environment feature. With the help of this feature, you would be able to differentiate parts of code.
								<li>In the case of long-running connections and communications, you would be offered support of WebSocket in ASP.NET
								
							</ul>
							</p>
							
							<h3>‘Gaze’ Backend Programming Language:</h3>
							<p>C# is an Object-Oriented programming language that will also be used as backend programming language for the Gaze. The Xamarin framework (acquired by Microsoft) allows you to program in C# against the .NET framework. The .NET framework is implemented on the iOS platform using an open-source implementation called mono. (Chebbi 2019)
							</p>
							<h3>Database server:</h3>
							<p>
							Microsoft SQL Server: It is relational database management system developed by Microsoft that we will use for Gaze database requirements. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications— which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.
							</p>
							<p>Cost of Azure SQL database:
							<br>Total cost of Azure SQL database for Gaze backend solution is around USD 2,952.86 per month. (MicrosoftAzure Pricing calculator 2021)
							</p>
							
							<h3>Web server:</h3>
							<p> IIS web server runs on the Microsoft .NET platform on the Windows OS. While it’s possible to run IIS on Linux and Macs using Mono, it’s not recommended and will likely be unstable. It’s versatile and stable, and it’s been widely used in production for many years. Version 10 is the most current.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Application server:</h3>
							<p>AppFabric: It is a set of middleware technologies for Windows Server, released by Microsoft. It consists of two main feature areas: AppFabric Hosting and AppFabric Caching. Microsoft support for these ended in November 2017. A newer version of the product from Microsoft is Service Fabric

							</p>
							<h3>Development and Design Tools </h3>
							These tools and technologies are currently used to build ‘Gaze’.
							<h3>GitHub:</h3>
							<p>
							GitHub enables users to access code quickly and work on projects in a timely manner. It's a source control and code repository that's free to use. Rather than sending files between members of the community, we will upload and distribute our code via GitHub. This will allow us to track the progress of the code and collaborate on it. (GitHub Guides, Hello World, 2020).
							</p>
							<p>GitHub will be useful to our group as we develop our Mobile Application because it will allow us to share code amongst ourselves. It will serve as the central location for us to upload, edit, and document all coding-related activities. GitHub is ideal for this because it allows all users to view and edit the code, as well as see any preview edits that have been made to the code. As a result, GitHub is required for us to complete our group project.

							<h3>Figma:</h3>
							<p>According to my research, the app's strength lies in its uniqueness and design; no such apps are available in the market. It has the potential to completely transform the way we report crime or incidents. According to one study, the average person spends five to six hours per day using their mobile phone, and another study shows that people use social apps for friends versus calling friends for two hours. Based on this trend, there is a strong probability that people will report crime / incident on app as opposed to traditional methods of calling or web browser based online reporting.

							<h2 class="major">Scope and Limits</h2>
							<p>
							Initially when designing and planning the scope of the project we had minimum and necessary feature in mind that we wanted to create for the mobile application. These being Sign in, Sign up and Guest Browsing, User Profile, Search Engine, Submitting a Report using Audio, Video or Photo, Ability to add/Use current Location.
							</p>
							<p>We believe we did not steer away or far from our initial scope when documenting, designing, and creating artefacts in correlation to our features. Our high fidelity Figma prototype displays a fully function and clickable model that displays all our features we planned to create.
							</p>
							<p>
							This is also exhibited through the Assignment 2 documentation and will be presented in the Assignment 5. Our scope can be seen in the section ‘Features’.
							</p>
							<p>Our limitation would our knowledge and inexperience in this area and resources.

							<h2 class="major">Plan and Progress</h2>
							<p>
							The Group 11 (codenamed "Orion") was a late-formed team. We were a week behind timetable from the start in terms of deciding which channel of technologies and ideas to pursue. One of the very first challenges we faced during the first few weeks of the semester was that the group was not formed based on the mutual interests of its members (like most other teams are), but rather on students who had not yet joined the group.
							</p>
							<p>
							We were having trouble getting responses from some of the group members. The current group leader attempted to communicate via email and even formed a group in Microsoft Teams, but even then, getting a response was difficult. Due to this, two members (Malak and Megha) considered joining another group, but everything worked out in the end. We were in the middle of assignment 2 when the group started talking. We spent a week reviewing each other's assignment 1 and getting to know each other. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The following phase of our work (weeks 5–7) was to make a decision what we wanted to build in a proposal and what the application would do. The group ‘jotted down' for several days on what types of applications each member of the group was knowledgeable with and wanted to develop. The goal of the conversation was to determine what other forms of would be useful to users and had not yet been developed by other tech firms. As stated in the “Aim and Motivation” section of this document, we planned on the application “Gaze” after many meetings and discussions.
							</p>
							<p>
							During weeks 6 and 7, the team collaborated closely on the development of the Team Project, a document that detailed the team members and proposed the project idea. After deciding on the proposed project and what the app would do, and after submitting the proposal, the next stage would be to begin work on the designing phase. The project's design began in weeks 9 and 10. Megha was working on prototypes, while the other team members were researching the assignment 2. The prototyping platform FIGMA was used for the large proportion of this design work.
							</p>
							<p>
							Our meeting scheduled for an average of 2 to 4 hours each week (2 weekly meetings), during which everyone provided constructive criticism on the assessment as well as the system 'Gaze.' We concurred on how the tasks would be divided amongst group member during weeks 8 to 11.
							</p>
							<p>The following tasks were associated with the work division:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Create the concept and procedures for that particular feature.</li>
								<li>Create a high-fidelity prototype of the functionality in FIGMA.</li>
								<li>Working on a document for Assignment 2.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Examples of the content that was created, refer to image 1 and 2 below:</p>
							<img src="images/1.png" alt="" width="394" height="290" />
							<p></p>
							<img src="images/2.png" alt="" width="266" height="508" />
							<p>Weeks 8 to 12 were perhaps the four most intensive and productivity weeks of the course thus far, and it was during these weeks that we realised and learnt some particularly essential concepts, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>How difficult it is to have " a town-meeting of too many people</li>
								<li>," that is, to have many people creating different aspects of the system and anticipate all of the components to come together seamlessly. As a result, we agreed that just one person would be responsible for the design.</li>
								<li>How to put together a structure and rules to deal with the problem mentioned previously.</li>
								<li>How much documentation is required to explain an apparently basic functionality in a succinct manner.</li>
								<li>How to get different project managers to agree on small system complexities and variances so that the project can proceed.</li>
								<li>The human side of a project is equally as vital as the technical side.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In addition, we discovered during week 8 that some of our original dates’ estimates were not entirely aligned with the dates we were needed to submit each particular assignment. For example, according to our original schedule, we were supposed to finish Assignment 2 by the 18th of May, but owing to unforeseen circumstances (members becoming sick, submitting the individual component, learning how to utilise new technology), it was pushed back to week 12.</p>
							<p>We had to improvise and re-arrange priorities, reassign work at the last minute, and "juggle commitments."</p>
							<p>By the end of week 7, each participant had completed their segment for Assessment 1 as well as their section for the project Gaze. The team leader (Megha Patel) compiled everyone's work and formatted it all to insure consistency. The first assignment as a group was submitted.</p>
							<p>Assignment 2 was a significant milestone for the group because it gave us more time to begin “hands-on-work” in the technical components of the work, which meant spending time discovering our preselected technologies and attempting to develop elements of the program.</p>
							<p>During weeks 8 and 12, the team investigated whether the assignment 1 methodology and planning processes were appropriate, as well as whether the Project idea in assessment 1 was strong enough to carry it through the next assessment (Assignment 2). Because our team members had no to very little previous experience with programming languages and mobile development, learning different frameworks from the ground up quickly became a challenge that we vastly underestimated.</p>
							<p>While the team thought that completing other elements of the course, such as the weekly modules, understanding how to use Microsoft Teams, logo maker (Wix), prototyping tools (Figma), and completing the assignments, should be achievable with considerable diligence, the team underestimated the complexities of learning new innovation frameworks (to make the actual mobile app).</p>
							<p>Everybody on the team was learning how to use new tools, technologies, and frameworks from our shortlist. We agreed after much deliberation and studies that we would be able to develop a high-fidelity prototype but not the efficient implementation. In the following weeks 9 and 10 the team worked on producing exceptional results toward Assignment 2. </p>
							<p>Some of the artifacts developed include:
							<br>Logo 
							<br>Gaze – We are looking! </p>
							<img src="images/1.png" alt=""width="394" height="290" />
							
							<h3>Home Page</h3> 
							<p>This is the home page of the application. User will be able to sign in if they have an account with Gaze. If no they have the option to continue as a Guest or they can sign up. 
							</p>

							<h3>User can submit a new report. </h3>
							<img src="images/5.png" alt=""  width="266" height="508" />
							<p>User will be navigated to this page after they choose the new report submission. They can choose Audio, Video or Photo to file up their case. </p>
							<p>User can select what type of incident they have faced/seen. They have the option to type their incident and if not, they can select or search it from the quick option given. </p>
							<img src="images/6.png" alt=""  width="266" height="508" />
							<img src="images/8.png" alt=""  width="266" height="508"  />
							<p>User can enter the location where the incident took a place by manual typing the address or using the GPS to track their location. User also have an option to provide details about the incident if they want and if they are comfortable. </p>
							<img src="images/7.png" alt="" width="266" height="508"/>
							<p>As of the date of authoring this document, the Group 11 got as far as having the system understanding, documented, including a high-fidelity interactive FIGMA prototype and mock-up using MOQUPS (refer to link below). </p>

							<p>Research on how to develop a mobile app as a beginner is still currently underway; however, considering the timeframes ahead, the chances of having a completely integrated functional system are perceived to be beyond the group's current delivery expertise.</p>
							<p>Some important components of this project that the group perceives as an oversight and would like to have spent much more time on are researching the implementation aspects of the core technologies selected, i.e., how to implement and establish app pages using a computer language and operating systems.</p>
							<p>To summarise, if we had been determined to troubleshoot these convergence complexities earlier in the assignment, we might have been capable of completing some more of the team's work integration</p>

							<h3>Megha</h3>
							<p>
							While working in the Team and on the assignment, I took on a variety of duties. As a Team Leader, I was chosen. Being a good leader necessitates a number of qualities. A group leader is responsible for not just engaging in the group and ensuring that the group's goal is met, but also inspiring the team, delivering success, organising meetings, splitting woks, contributing extra effort if any of the member is absent and serving as a resource for group members. 
							</p>
							<p>I was in charge of designing the prototype with Figma and MoqUps, compiling and formatting the report (documentation), organising files on GitHub, and contributing to large chunks of assignment 1 and 2.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Pratibha</h3>
							<p>I don’t have any specific role in building our application. As, I cannot use programming language, I could not contribute to app development. But I helped my team in other works such as research, finding risks and solutions, doing validity tests, and going through the funding plan. I helped in writing the content for the project. I believe my role was important in a group and I contributed my parts sincerely
							</p>
							
							<h3>Suruchi</h3>
							<p>I didn’t have specific role, but I contributed in Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 in different sections as per to the requirement and my interest. As a first unit of the course, I am still learning the concept of the Information Technology. Our Team Leader, Megha helped me to understand and breakdown the assignment for everyone. I really enjoy research therefore in Assignment 1, I contributed in IT Technologies and in this assignment i was able to explore different tool and technologies, different platform and what it really requires to build a IT System. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>Shruti</h3>
							<p>Even though it is helpful to define roles for particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical Designer, or User Interface Designer, I do not have any specific functions for our project. As I do not have any history of coding and programming, I felt comfortable contributing to the writing part of the assignment. I think Megha and Malak are better for creating the app. However, I have shared my views and ideas about the Gaze app now and then in the chats and group meetings. This is crucial as I am writing about the plans and progress of the app in Assignment 3. I have to be up to date about different features and functions added to the app to write about it. I believe I have been sincere on my part and have documented how the app began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the plan we are up to. I have included a significant amount of detail of the progress to easily see what we have done to date and what we are planning to do in the future. I have also written the current and future risks of the Gaze app from the perspective of users or clients.
							</p>
							
								
							<h3>Malak</h3>
							<p>As everyone else, I didn’t have specific role to play. My role in the assignment was to conduct research on tools and technologies for the Project. During my research, I learned a lot. I have shared my thoughts and ideas about the various features that would improve our application. Before we decided on these ideas, we conducted some research on the app, and I was a part of it. The main part of the assignment is documentation, and I believe I have contributed a higher quality of work that will be seen as a final result.

							<h2 class="major">Aim and Goal</h2>
							
							<h3>Aim</h3>
							<p>							
							To develop an app to make society a better place by enabling layman report crimes and emergency incidents effortlessly without putting themselves in danger and help the concerned departments work more efficiently minimising chances of loss of lives and other damages
							</p>
							
							<h3>Goal</h3>
							<p>
							The main goal of the ‘Gaze’ is to provide a quick and easy solution to report an incident or crime with help of few clicks in a reliable app. The app will allow users to report any emergency or incident in seconds with just four quick taps on their smartphone (IOS or Android). It will be distinct from other conventional methods of contacting emergency departments as it will provide evidence of the incident on the spot in the form of image, video, or audio clip. It can provide accurate and detailed information about the situation.
							</p>
							<p>
							In some cases, calling the cops can land the person in a trouble. Making a video, taking picture, or recording audio clip would reduce the risk of being overheard by the culprit. The location can be automatically shared which will save time and damage can be minimised. It will have a very user-friendly and simple interface so that the user does not get bogged down in complexities. This app is going to be different as it can be used to report all types of incidents in one app unlike Emergency+, Fires near me etc. It will aid in providing first-hand visual or audio for the best response and response time. 
							</p>
							<p>
							It will work in online mode (photos and videos included) or offline mode (no video or photo included, only for quick sending, i.e., the text only report) in areas with limited signals. It will also have the option of hiding the identity of the person reporting the crime, as many crimes go unreported due to fear of identity disclosure. They don't even have to leave the house to report it. Which are some of the most common reasons why people do not report crime. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>Features</h3>
							<h4>Homepage</h4>
							<p>
							The homepage is the first thing user will see when they open the app. The user would be able to access their account through homepage. To sign in with this app we need our email address, and a strong password needs to be created. This app also gives users the option of signing in as a visitor or creating a new account. Further to create an account with Gaze users need to accept terms and conditions to use the app and can continue using the app.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Submit New Report</h4>
							<p>
							When you log in to this app, a page called Submit New Report will appear, where you can choose from police, ambulance, and fire emergency services. To use any of the emergency services, user can simply click on the picture button of police, ambulance, and fire.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Submission Type</h4>
							<p>
							After selecting the appropriate emergency service, you will be directed to a page with audio, video, and photo options on which you can apply your case. If you do not have any proof to file your case, you can even skip this page
							</p>
							
							<h4>Type of Incident</h4>
							<p>
							Once you've decided how to file your complaint, you'll be taken to the Type of Incident tab. This page helps users to choose or browse for an incident to record, as well as type your own incident in depth.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Location</h4>
							<p>
							This software also has extra features that enable users to manually type in the address where the incident occurred or monitor their location using GPS. If the user wishes and is comfortable, they can also provide information about the incident in the description box.
							</p>
							
							<h4>News Report</h4>
							<p>
							This app will also provide users with additional NEWS stream functionality. In one short, elegant app, it will contain all we need to make sense of the week.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Building of the App</h4>
							<p>
							The key goal of this app is to make it easier for our users to report incidents in a fast and convenient manner. First, we'll gather all the necessary material, such as different tools, software, photos, and details, for our inspiration to design the app. If we were to start a budling the application without any support and funds (as a student), we will use MIT App Inventor, Java, SQL, HTML, and C++. Different apps and resources will be needed for different sections of the app. We'll use MIT App Inventor and Java to build the app's graphical or user interface. The programming languages Java and C++ can be used to describe the app's features and processes, such as transferring data to other computers. We will continue to draw, create, and review after the data has been collected so that we can begin to understand how all the data and information we have gathered will affect our design. SQL would be used to parts of app that need communication with database e.g., storing or retrieving of data and information. Not only we will brainstorm and analyse solutions but will also solicit suggestions. We will present our app to as many people as possible, including families, students, experts, and everyone who we believe will provide valuable feedback and check whether it works or not. Considering all our suggestions to determine whether they can be implemented. It's common to go back through the Design Process to refine and simplify solutions.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Benefit of the app</h4>
							<p>
							Both the public and the government or relevant agencies will benefit from the Gaze app. It would aid in reducing the effects of accidents or criminal activity. It will also keep track of the accidents. The user's submitted video or audio clip may be used as evidence. It can assist them in resolving criminal cases. This is going to be a life-saving app that provides immediate assistance. Photos, audio, and video submitted to the appropriate agency will aid in a clearer understanding of the condition and its severity. It may also be used to track minor accidents to make society a safer and more pleasant environment. That would make the work of the emergency room easier in terms of eradicating violence and improving public safety. This app will obviously make it easier for any ordinary person to register an emergency in a more reliable and accurate manner. With an extra feature of News in this app, user can get updated news feed instantly.

							<p>This time things went much smoother as a group. Megha once again proved to be a good
leader and all the team members did their part on time without any hassle. We had regular
meetings which helped in clarity and division of the tasks. We had excellent coordination and
stayed in touch through MS teams throughout whenever needed. Last time because of only one
group member the whole team suffered, and the quality of assignment was compromised after
he left things got much easier and clearer as everyone worked responsibly and with dedication.
I only wish somebody from the group had helped me a bit with the technical part as I already
mentioned that I have no background in app development. It would have made my work much
easier. Anyhow overall I was satisfied with our overall group effort.</p>
							<p>From this experience I learned that every member of the team is important and because of one
irresponsible person the whole group suffers. Better conflict management strategy is required to
deal with such situations rather than waiting till the end when quality is compromised due to lack
of time because of one person’s irresponsibility.</p>
							<p>If there is understanding, coordination and most importantly communication between the team
members bigger tasks can be easily achieved saving time and energy. Which was fortunately
the case with us in assignment 3 which led to a pleasant work environment and more
productivity. </p>
							<p>I am thankful to every member of the team and our group leader Megha. Without them it would
be impossible to complete this assignment.</p>

							<p>I am delighted to be a part of Group 11, and I have the utmost respect for everyone's
contributions in Assignment 2 and 3. After Assignment 2, we had to let go of one of our team
members after consulting with the teachers. We understand his difficulties, but he would not
communicate with us.</p>
							<p>We had a fresh start for Assignment 3, and I was excited to work with my group. We were
unable to decide on our parts, and hence Megha did a great job as a team leader and
distributed the tasks among us. We were comfortable with the roles assigned to us.</p>
							<p>All the team members are busy with their work and personal lives. It was again challenging to
manage time for the group meetings. I believe we overcame this problem as we held meetings
twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). Those who could not attend meetings on
Wednesdays could join discussions on Saturdays or vice versa. Also, we are always connected
through chats and texts. </p>
							<p>Malak, Megha, Suruchi, Pratibha and I have become comfortable with each other, and we can
talk about other things apart from the assignment. Everyone is always ready to help other team
members. Hence, I can say that we have progressed after each meeting, and we were
constantly communicating through Microsoft teams.

							<p>I am confident that our team can work effectively together to complete a common task without
conflict. Team Orion excels at communicating and taking tasks, as well as starting up where
other team members left off, which was critical to our success, especially as we all have various
commitment schedules. If there is one thing we could do better this time, it would be to spend
more time or work on some parts of the assignment together. This way, we can spend more
time together and work will be more aligned with each other, avoiding work at the end when the
document is being finalised. Life got in the way of our complete dedication to this evaluation.
It's been wonderful to work with Team Orion, and I've been continually impressed by my team's
effort and expertise, which is a result of some of my previous experiences; it's nice to have a
productive team this time around.</p>
							<p>I believe that everyone's work ethic is extremely valuable in our group. There was not a single
instance of conflict or disagreement. Our communication was excellent; whenever you needed
to contact another member, they were there within an hour with a response and a solution.
Despite the fact that each member of our team is juggling work, family, and school, we were
able to maintain efficient and constructive contact.</p>
							<p>As a Team Leader, I am extremely proud of my team's ability to stand firm and approach tasks
and each other with great respect.</p>
							<p>As mentioned previously, we are four girls in the group and it’s a great feeling. We get along
and maybe we can meet up as we all live in Sydney. Pratibha, Suruchi and Shruti are from a
different course. They were bit worried and thought they might not be able to deliver the same
amount work, but they are doing an excellent job in the assignment. Pratibha is spontaneous
with her response. She will be the first person to reply in a group regarding any questions that
might be raised or even if is just to decide small details. Suruchi and Shruti, I assumed they
were sisters because they shared a surname and a first letter. When I first joined the team, they
were both the first members of the group 11, which supported my belief that they were sisters,
but I was mistaken! They certainly aren't! I have nothing negative to say about them; whatever
was assigned to them was completed ahead of the deadline set by the team and myself.
Attending meetings, as mentioned Malak attended meeting while he was at work, Pratibha has
joined the meeting while she at a party once, Suruchi and Shruti were able to join a meeting
when travelling in a train which shows their commitments, and I wouldn’t want to justify it more.</p>
							<p>Group projects isn't so bad as long as everyone is dedicated to the task at hand. It was pleasant
to join a team of like-minded people who wanted to succeed in this unit, which is refreshing in
correlation to the university group work preconceptions.</p>

							<p>As compared in the assignment 2, group coordination in this assignment went well. We did plenty
of meetings and accomplished our parts on time. We had four major meetings each of about one
hour and recorded those meetings. We had few other short meetings when we needed to discuss
on small topics. The links of recordings of our two meetings are listed below:

Megha played a perfect role as a team member by allocating our work, checking and organising
our parts.</p>
							<p>All of us team members contributed our part on time. We communicated in team about our
progress, complications, and suggestions.</p>
							<p>The stress was much reduced than before. We understood properly about what was expected
from each of us. The main thing we removed one group member who seriously affected our
assignment 2. Apart from the effectiveness of the team, I felt that we depended on our team
leader to accomplish task. We should have ability to work independently within the group to
make the group perfect. But we did not overburden our leader and accomplished the assigned
task perfectly on time. The surprising part of this assignment was the easy accomplishment
comparative to the previous assignment. We were concerned that we will need to work a lot due
to the complexity of the assignment. But we managed to work collaboratively to simplify our
tasks. The main things I have learned from this group are the cooperation, collaboration, and
coordination. The group work is incomplete without the equal contribution from each member.
When people work in groups, their potentiality combine and ultimately the group achieves
greater productivity than an individual can achieve.</p>
<p>
Without these group members, I would be unable to reach the requirements of the assignment.
Thanks to all.</p>

							<p>3rd Assignment, our IT project was an eye-opening learning experience. It encouraged me to
collaborate with my former group members from assignment 2, though one of our team
members had to be excluded due to his carelessness.</p>
							<p>We got straight to strike on our assignment, remembering our previous work. We started late on
the last assignment and struggled due to a lack of time. All went fine, as our group leader
(Megha) was once again in charge of this team. She assigned tasks to each team member
because we were unsure where to begin. The assignment of work made it much easier to finish
our mission, and we didn't have to fail as much as we had on the previous assignment.</p>
							<p>Since everyone was working full time, we had a hard time getting everyone to the meetings.
Suruchi (me), Megha, and Pratibha were present in the evenings, while Shruti and Malak were available in the mornings. Despite the implications, we were able to involve everyone in a few
meetings and communicate with them through chat as necessary.</p>
							
							<p>Working with the same people in the same group made me more open and less stressed. We
now have a solid alliance. After our assignment conversation, we also spoke about our country,
traditions, festivals, and movies to relieve tension from the assignment. I had a nice time
listening to my teammates and having a good time.</p>
